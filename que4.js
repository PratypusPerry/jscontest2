//var is a function scoped method of doing a variable declaration while let is a block scoped method of variable declaration
//For the let keyword it does not matter whether or not you have used a same name for a variable before as a let declared variable exists only within its block as it is block scoped.a variable cannot be declared more than once within a scope, then the problem discussed earlier that occurs with var does not happen for let but in var all thse are common problems.
